PIC-MAXI-WEB development board

This project is all about PIC programming experimental board. The aim of this is to build a real time clock. The source code is in t `main.c` file.

To make all of this work, install first the compiler and run the makefile. Then connect the PIC-MAXI-WEB board through `Ethernet` cable and upload the code. Follow the compiling instructions in `[downloaded_file-48.pdf](PIC18F97J60/blob/master/downloaded_file-48.pdf)` file.
